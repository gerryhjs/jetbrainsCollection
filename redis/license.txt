Provided, however, Licensee may make the Software available to a third party to operate the Software on behalf of Licensee (such as a cloud provider), subject to the terms and conditions of this EULA, and provided that Licensee shall be fully liable for such third party's compliance with the terms and conditions of this EULA.

(4)	Financial Terms.  Except as otherwise provided in the applicable Order Form, we will send you an invoice for the initial license fees upon execution of the Order Form.

Except as otherwise provided in an applicable Order Form, all payment obligations are non-cancelable and non-contingent and all amounts paid are nonrefundable except as set forth herein.  All invoices are due and payable within thirty (30) days of receipt. If we don't receive timely payment, we reserve the right to suspend the impacted Software or service and charge a late fee equal to the lesser of one percent (1%) per month or the maximum amount allowed by law in addition to our cost of collection. You will pay applicable sales, use, goods and services, value-added, or equivalent indirect taxes and duties unless you timely give us documentary evidence of exemption as prescribed by the tax authorities. We shall ensure our invoices state taxes separately and meet local statutory invoicing requirements to enable you to seek recovery of the indirect taxes collected and remitted by us.
